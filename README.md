# Introduction
###
Climate change is a global challenge that has become increasingly urgent to address. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), are the main contributors to global warming and climate change (Shi, 2018). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global average temperature has increased by 1.1oC since pre-industrial times, and it is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades if emissions continue to rise at the current rate (IPCC, 2021).
One way to address this challenge is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this, it is important to understand the sources and drivers of emissions, as well as the factors that influence them.
## Statement of the Promblem 
###
The most recent past decade, which includes year 2011 through year 2020 was observed to be the hottest decade. With current trends, global temperatures are expected to rise by another 1.5oC between 2030 and 2052, which would lead to more frequent and severe climate-related disasters (IPCC, 2021). 
Given the significant impacts of climate change, it is essential to monitor its effects in order to understand the scope of the problem and develop effective solutions
## Historical emission prediction approaches
###
The Forecasting of transportation-related energy demand and CO2 emissions in Turkey with different machine learning algorithms by Umit Agbulut, and Machine learning based time series models for effective CO2 emission prediction in India by Surbhi Kumari and Suni Kumar Singh are similar co2 prediction studies. 
Kumari and Singh used three statistical models which were the autoregressive-integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the seasonal autoregressive-integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model, and the Holt-Winters model, and two machine learning models, i.e., linear regression and random forest model and a deep learning based long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Agbulut used Deep Learning (DL), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
An exploration of clustering and classification machine learning algorithms will inform new ideas and aid the creation of predictive models.
## Aims and Objectives
###
The main aim of this project is to identify the causes of the country-level emission patterns and build solutions that can better forecast expected emission trends. This will aid with policy-making and decision taking. 
Build predictive models to forecast future emissions trends by location.
Analyze the changes in emissions across different countries.  
Present an analysis of emission trends by types (e.g., CO2, CH4, or N2O etc).
Developing an understanding of the detrimental effect of the different types of emissions based on predictions for the next 10 years.
